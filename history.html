           From Newton Heath to Manchester United
        </h2> 
        <p>
             The club was formed as Newton Heath LYR in 1878 by workers from the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. Renamed Manchester United in 1902, the club won its first English league championship in 1907-08. In 1910 the club moved from its old Bank Street ground into Old Trafford stadium, which has served as the teams home ever since.

            Manchester Uniteds history since World War II has been dominated by two long-serving managers:

                <p>
                     Sir Matthew Busby was appointed manager in 1945 and over the next 24 years steered the club to five English league and two FA Cup victories. The club had to contend with tragedy in 1958 when an aircraft carrying the team crashed in Munich, killing 23 of the 44 onboard. In the 1960s the team, rebuilt by Busby, included the highly talented attacking trio of Bobby Charlton, George Best, and Denis Law. In 1968 this team became the first English club to win the European Cup (now known as the Champions League) with a 4-1 victory over Benfica of Portugal in the final.

                    The former coach of the Scottish team Aberdeen, Alex Ferguson, managed the club from 1986 to 2013 and presided over an unparalleled spell of dominance in the English league. Manchester United has won 12 Premier League titles since that leagues inaugural season in 1992-93. In the 1998-99 season the club secured the first “treble” in English football history by winning the Premier League, the FA Cup, and the Champions League. A second Champions League victory came in the 2007-08 season. Dramatically, the club lost another possible title on the last day of the 2011-12 season, when the other top Premier League team in the city, Manchester City FC, snatched the league title on point difference. The two Premier League clubs have elevated the citys status worldwide.
